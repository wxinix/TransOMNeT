# TransOMNeT
High performance integration bridge for TransModeler traffic simulator and OMNeT++ for V2X simulation.

**TransOMNeT** is an open-source, high-performance integration bridge between [TransModeler](https://www.caliper.com/transmodeler/) ‚Äî a professional-grade microscopic traffic simulation platform ‚Äî and [OMNeT++](https://www.omnetpp.org/), a modular, event-driven network simulator. This bridge enables cyber-physical co-simulation of connected transportation systems for research, security testing, and secure-by-design ITS development.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: TransOMNeT is an independent open-source project. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the OMNeT++ development teams. OMNeT++ is a trademark of OpenSim Ltd.


## ‚ú® Features

- Seamless **in-process coupling** between OMNeT++ and TransModeler
- **Pure C++ implementation** for unmatched performance and portability
- **Sub-microsecond latency** using shared memory or COM-based IPC
- Support for:
  - Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) simulation
  - SPaT and MAP message exchange
  - Cyber-attack injection and resilience testing
- Modular architecture designed for extension and experimentation


## üöÄ Why TransOMNeT Performs Exceptionally Well

**TransOMNeT is engineered for simulation performance and scalability**, avoiding the typical bottlenecks of socket-based or script-driven integration frameworks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Pure C++ Architecture

- Built entirely in **modern C++20**
- No Python, Java, or interpreter layers
- Full control over memory, threading, and simulation timing

### üîó In-Process OMNeT++ Execution

- OMNeT++ is embedded directly as a simulation engine within TransModeler
- Avoids launching subprocesses or relying on external schedulers
- Simulation events are co-stepped in **tick-accurate sync**

### üîÑ Zero-Copy IPC via Shared Memory or In-Process COM

- Vehicle state, signal timing, and simulation hooks are exchanged using:
  - **In-process COM interfaces** (near-function call latency)
  - **Shared memory buffers** for batch updates
- No network stacks, no marshalling, no latency drift

### üß™ Real-Time and Faster-Than-Real-Time Execution

- Designed to support both real-time digital twin environments and offline, faster-than-real-time analysis
- Easily handles **10k+ vehicles** with responsive cyber-physical feedback

### üìâ Benchmark: IPC Latency Comparison

| Method                         | Typical Latency |
|-------------------------------|------------------|
| **TransOMNeT (COM/shared mem)** | **< 1 Œºs**       |
| Veins (TraCI via TCP)         | ~100‚Äì500 Œºs     |
| Socket-based co-simulation    | 1‚Äì2 ms           |
